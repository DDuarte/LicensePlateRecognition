    How fast match template works:
    1. Both target and source image are down sampled numDownPyrs times
    2. cvMatchTemplate() function is called on shrunken images
       (uses CCORR_NORMED algorithm)
    3. The numMaxima best locations are found
    4. For each point where a maxima was located:
       a) Original source image is searched at point +/- searchExpansion
          pixels in both x and y direction
    5. If match score is above matchPercentage then the location and score is
       saved in the foundPointsList and confidencesList, respectively
    6. If findMultipleTargets is true, an attempt will be made to find up to
       numMaxima targets
    7. (Optional) The targets can be drawn to a color version of the source
       image using the DrawFoundTargets() function

  FastMatchTemplate
  Performs a fast match template
  Returns: true on success, false on failure
  Parameters:
    source - source image (where we are searching)
    target - target image (what we are searching for)
    foundPointsList - contains a list of the points where the target was found
    confidencesList - contains a list of the confidence value (0-100) for each
                      found target
    matchPercentage - the minimum required match score to consider the target
                      found
    findMultipleTargets - if set to true, the function will attempt to find a
                          maximum of numMaxima targets
    numMaxima - the maximum number of search locations to try before exiting
                (i.e. when image is down-sampled and searched, we collect the
                best numMaxima locations - those with the highest confidence -
                and search the original image at these locations)
    numDownPyrs - the number of times to down-sample the image (only increase
                  this number if your images are really large)
    searchExpansion - The original source image is searched at the top locations
                      with +/- searchExpansion pixels in both the x and y
                      directions
